## ✨ Core Features

### 🧠 LLM-Based Feedback Analysis

Paste your peer feedback and get a **structured critique** on how well you gave it — clarity, tone, constructiveness, actionability, and organization — all powered by Google Gemini.

### 🧩 Rewrite Matching Game

Transform weak feedback into strong suggestions with an **interactive drag-and-drop activity**. Match bad phrases to their rewritten versions in a clean, two-column UI.

### 💾 Downloadable Rewrite Certificates

Once the matches are completed, generate a **beautifully styled HTML file** containing the full rewrite suggestions personalized with your name. Great for submission or reflection.

### 🌓 Clean, Responsive UI

Includes:

* Light/dark mode toggle ☀️🌙
* Custom instruction overrides for the LLM
* Smart conditional UI (e.g., download only appears after interaction)

## 🎓 A Note on Intent

This tool isn’t for evaluating student work — it’s for helping students **reflect on how they give feedback**. Meta-critique is the name of the game: improving how we help each other grow.
